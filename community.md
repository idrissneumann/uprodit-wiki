## Git repositories

Here's our git repositories:

* Gitlab mirror: https://gitlab.com/ineumann/uprodit-wiki.git

You can use all those repositories in order to:
* Send us pull requests/merge requests if you think there's room of improvments
* Open tickets for any bug you want to share about uprodit.com or its API
* Ask for new features or evolutions

## Slack workspace

You also can ask for joining our [slack workspace](https://uprodit-tech.slack.com) for asking help or sharing with the community. Send us an email to `support@uprodit.com` for getting an invitation.

You can there directly talk with the team if you're not quick enough on the tickets but also share your technical insights with the rest of the community and get help by the other members.


## Contact form

We also have our classic contact form here.
